FONTLOG for the Haydn font
==========================

This file provides detailed information on the Haydn Font Software. This information should be distributed along with the Haydn fonts and any derivative works.


Basic font information
----------------------
Haydn is a typeface designed by Abraham Lee to resemble a style of music publishing by famous publishers such as Edition Peters. The glyph set comes from various original scores. This font software is not designed for use in a word-processing application, although all the glyphs may be accessed at their respective Unicode points. It was originally designed for use with LilyPond, the automatic music engraver.
